# Design Doc.

The reason i chose to use modules, is that by creating compartments of all the resources, you get a clearer overview over the resources and it makes the deploymentscript more deployable. Certain resources can be really big and need time to be deployed. When there is a lot in one script, in my experience, it will make the script harder to process and have a chance to fail more often.
